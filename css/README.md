# Challenge-2
Homework Assigment
----------------------------------------------------
This is my attempt at recreating a website similar to the one in the Mockup 
given to us. The difference will be in the Style.

Work Process
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Body & Overall Page 
I started at the html level to structure and order all of the elements and corresponding classes, so it could be understood as best as possible.

2. First Section & Main
It was fairly easy to wrap the header and first paragraph, so when zooming in and out it would be uniform and all the elements would stay in place. I specifically used display:flex and flex direction for the direction of choice.

3.  Second Section
I had many, many issues with the images as I thought they would automatically be uniformed with the flex attribute applied in the body. I finally created an individual layout for each image, Font, and Box that show the decription of the picture. I used Display:Flex for Main and Position:Relative for Each Image, Font, and Box. In the future I would love to shorten this process by grouping multiple elements together to get the same affect.

4. Third Section, Side Points and Images 
For the rightside About Me, Work, Contact Me, I used border-right syntax to create the vertical line and chose the side, height and positioning that I wanted. 

5. I had help from a tutor to create the nav buttons and hire me bonus button at the top of the header and Hero Banner. However once I completed my work the button for Work no longer scrolls down the page. I was unable to get it to work again.

6. Lastly, there is what seems to look like and endless void after Contact Me. I was unable to correct that as well.
